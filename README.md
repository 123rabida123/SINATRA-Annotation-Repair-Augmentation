# SINATRA-Annotation-Repair-Augmentation
SINATRA is an all-in-one and automatic approach that helps to bridge these gaps  of data quality by providing the following features: data annotation (to address mis- spelled and incomplete metadata issues), data repair (to address missing values (data) issues), data augmentation (to dynamically add meaningful columns and corresponding cell values to data).

The Source code of the SINATRA approach is here: https://github.com/Cabi-96/STI-Thesis .
